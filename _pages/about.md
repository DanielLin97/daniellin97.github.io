This is Hongzhan Lin, a PhD candidate at NLP Lab of Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU), advised by [Prof. Jing Ma](https://majingcuhk.github.io/). I also visited NExT++ Lab of National University of Singapore (NUS), working under the guidance of [Prof. Tat-Seng Chua](https://www.chuatatseng.com/) from 2024 to 2025. Before, I obtained both of my B.E. and M.E. degree from PRIS Lab of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in 2019 and 2022 respectively, advised by [Prof. Guang Chen](https://x.com/fly51fly). Early on I was working as a research intern in Tencent (with AI Lab).
