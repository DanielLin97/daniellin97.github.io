Working with me ðŸ¤—
If you are a CS student, please feel free to email me with your CV. I take mentorship seriously and believe in working closely with my mentees rather than simply assigning tasks. Together, we can explore the following areas:

Impactful Research
Open-source Software Applications
Recent advances in Multimodal ML, Information Retrieval, Fact-Checking, Large Language Models, Code Intelligence, etc.
If you want to get a sense of my work, you can read my papers. However, please keep in mind that I have a few constraints. Due to availability, I can only mentor a limited number of students at the same time.
